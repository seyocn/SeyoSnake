# SeyoSnake 2.0

A snake game with OpenCV.

The original development environment is Visual Studio 2013 with OpenCV 2.4.8

But this project doesn't need the number of the version that mentioned above.

I just provide cpp file and some necessary resource files.

You should build the environment of compiling by yourself, include OpenCV library.
